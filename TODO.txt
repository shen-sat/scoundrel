Actions:
deal deck itself
- deal cards DONE
- arrange context DONE
- flip cards
	- copy over to card object from shape object
	- then refactor - the animation logic will be shared, most likely
	- NOTE: you can't pass objects to another update fn, cos then you have to duplicate `current_time += 1` everywhere. Better to create an object for controls and disable it when running an animation. (Or it could take in all other objects and only run when all other objects are in a certain state)
- make cursor appear
deal hero
deal torch
dialogue pop up
cursor
- move
- select
- card actions:
	- equip sword (and reset dice)
	- heal
	- fight (and adjust dice)
	- flip (torch)
- all card animations
- start
- game over
- game win
- candle
- tutorial




Game over notes:
Last card will be a treasure chest, with cursor. When player selects, it will open and jewel will rise out

Flip animation:
start card x, y = 92,34
frame 1:
- rectfill white
	- x,y = 96,31
	- x1,y1 = 109,62
- rectfill black
	- x,y = 97,33
	- x1,y1 = 108,60
frame 2:
- rectfill white
	- x,y = 102,28
	- x1,y1 = 103,59
frame 3:
- rectfill white
	- x,y = frame 1 x,y
	- x1,y1 = frame 1 x1,y1

	frame_1:
	- rectfill white
		- x,y = parent_x + (96-92),31
		- x1,y1 = 109,62
	- rectfill black
		- x,y = 97,33
		- x1,y1 = 108,60
