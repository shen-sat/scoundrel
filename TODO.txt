Im coding a card game. A pack of 52 cards is initialised. Then 4 cards are dealt along a top row. If the card is a clubs/spades, the card is a monster. hearts is a potion. diamonds is a sword.
The bottom row contains 4 items: health score, sword durability score, a sword card (if equipped) and a torch.
Each turn the player can select a card from the top row and/or bottom row to perform an action.
eg player selects a potion in top row = health is added to the health score and option is removed from top row. Or player selects a sword in top row = sword is placed in bottom row
